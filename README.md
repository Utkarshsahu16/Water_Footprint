# 💧 Water-Prediction: Water Footprint Awareness & Prediction Platform

![Project Logo](Images/NewLogo.png)

## 🌱 Project Overview

Water-Prediction is a web platform dedicated to raising awareness about water footprints and providing actionable solutions for effective water management. The platform educates users on the environmental impact of their water usage, empowers them to make informed choices, and offers personalized strategies for reducing water consumption. It features a machine learning-powered calculator to predict water usage for different crops based on environmental conditions.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1. Frontend

- Open `Water/index - Copy.html` in your browser to explore the platform.

### 2. Backend (ML Model)

- Navigate to the `ML Model/` directory.
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install flask flask-cors pandas scikit-learn joblib
  ```
- Run the Flask app:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
- The calculator will send POST requests to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict` for water usage prediction.
